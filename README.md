# Convert Nintendo 3DS 3D video to side-by-side format

Shell script to call ffmpeg to convert stereoscopic 3D videos from the Nintendo 3DS into side-by-side videos, viewable in VR (HTC Vive, Valve Index...) and other 3D viewers

Thanks to https://www.reddit.com/user/amoliski/ for help with the ffmpeg command.
